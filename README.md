# New Theory of Everything - Indivison Theory

## Abstract
This theory aims to bridge the gap between the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Theory by providing an alternative explanation for the nature of the universe.

This theory can explain:

* Dark Matter
* Dark Energy
* Light wave-particle duality
* Superposition and Collapse after measurement
* Faster than light particles
* Origin of mass
* Why mass slow down time(change)
* Why speed slow down time
* Gravity
* Redshift of Light: Doppler Redshift and Wear-and-tear Redshift
* Big Bang
* Black hole
* Vacuum Energy
* Quantum Foam

Basic rule of Indivison Theory:

Everything in the universe (including photon, all known particles in Standard Model, electric field, magnetic field, gravity) is made of tiny dots called “Indivison”. All indivisons move through space at a constant speed faster than light and the speed never changes. When changes happen, the total momentum and mass center of any group of indivisons involved in change remains the same.
